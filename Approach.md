# Approach for the Dual Research Agent

## Problem Statement
The task was to create a dual research agent capable of retrieving relevant information from the web and providing structured answers based on the retrieved data. The key challenge was ensuring accuracy, credibility, and efficiency in retrieving and generating answers.

## Initial Approach
The first idea was a straightforward approach: query the Tavily API for relevant search results, process the response, and use an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate an answer. The answer would then be displayed to the user. While functional, this approach had limitations:
- It did not provide transparency regarding the sources of the information.
- The LLM could generate responses without citing sources, reducing trustworthiness.
- Every query required a fresh API call, making it inefficient for frequently asked questions.

## Enhancing Credibility and Source Attribution
A major improvement was to include the raw content of the search results along with metadata. This allowed the LLM to generate responses while also providing citations for the information. By feeding the retrieved metadata to the LLM, the user could see where each particular point in the answer came from, enhancing trust in the system.

## Adding Memory to the System
To improve efficiency, the next enhancement was to introduce memory into the system. The idea was to store previously retrieved answers so that if a similar question was asked again, the system could return a stored response instead of making a fresh API call. However, this required:
- A way to compare new queries with stored data.
- A mechanism to ensure stored data remained relevant over time.

### Using a Vector Database
To achieve memory and efficient retrieval, a vector database was chosen. Vector databases are particularly useful for clustering similar elements together using embeddings. By storing search results and their embeddings, the system could:
- Compare new queries with stored ones using cosine similarity.
- Retrieve relevant results from the database if they were still recent and relevant.
- Only query the API for fresh data if required, reducing unnecessary API calls.

## Alternative Considerations
Another potential approach was to use a traditional NLP method to analyze the retrieved content and extract the most relevant information before passing it to the LLM. However, this approach had limitations:
- It would require custom NLP processing to extract relevant information.
- If the NLP model failed to find an answer, the LLM might generate an answer without actual references, reducing reliability.
- The complexity of implementing an effective NLP solution was high compared to using embeddings and a vector database.

Since the goal was to retrieve the latest information accurately and efficiently, the NLP approach was deemed too complex for the initial implementation, and the focus remained on using LLMs combined with structured retrieval.

## Integration with LangChain and LangGraph
To structure the overall flow of the system, LangChain and LangGraph were used. These frameworks helped organize the process into a clear sequence:
1. **Retrieve relevant documents**: Query the vector database for stored results or fetch new data from the web if necessary.
2. **Generate an answer**: Use an LLM to create a structured response while citing sources.
3. **Store and reuse results**: Save retrieved documents and answers for future queries.

## Conclusion
This approach ensures that the system:
- Retrieves trustworthy information from the web.
- Provides source attribution for credibility.
- Stores past results to improve efficiency and reduce redundant API calls.
- Uses vector embeddings to cluster similar queries and improve retrieval.

By leveraging LLMs, vector databases, and structured flow management with LangChain and LangGraph, the dual research agent is both effective and scalable for answering user queries accurately and efficiently.
